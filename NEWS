==============
Version 0.81.0
==============

- Migrated the project to https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libhandy/.
  - Archived the project at https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/.
  - Updated URLs and email addresses across the project.
  - Switch the CI to use GNOME's.
  - Build and publish the nightly reference manual via GitLab Pages at
    https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libhandy/.
- Make the reference manual and the Glade catalog parallel-installable
  with libhandy 0.0.
- Add a Python override to ensure the library is initialized on import.
- Themes:
  - Add the HighContrast theme.
  - Split the shared theme into the fallback theme whose style can be
    overridden by other themes, and the shared theme whose style
    overrides the themes.
  - Move window corners from the shared theme to Adwaita, so elementary
    can do what they want.
  - Make the leaflet and deck drop shadows darker for dark variants and
    HighContrast, to ensure it's visible.
  - Drop the .h4 fallback to avoid conflicts with .heading. Themes are
    now expected to implement .heading, or optionally .h4.
  - Fix list.preferences nested list bottom corner rounding issues.
- CSS support:
  - Account for the CSS box-shadow property when clipping in HdyAvatar,
    HdyHeaderBar, and HdyTitleBar.
  - Support the CSS min-width and min-height properties in HdyHeaderBar,
    and HdyTitleBar.
- HdyDeck and HdyLeaflet:
  - Add *_get_adjacent_child() to get the child a swipe or a call to
    *_navigate() would present.
  - Don't skip the swipes with a 0 (child for leaflet) transition
    duration.
  - Correctly cancel transitions when the duration is 0 or the
    transition is NONE.
- HdyCarousel:
  - Allow mouse drag by default.
  - Add the 'reveal-duration' property.
  - Animate child addition and deletion.
- HdyExpanderRow:
  - Move switch to the left of the arrow.
  - Add hdy_expander_row_add_action_widget() and the 'action' child type
    to allow adding widgets before the arrow and the switch.
- HdyHeaderBar:
  - Add the .titlebar style class by default.
- HdyKeypad:
  - Make it inherit from GtkBin instead of GtkGrid, contain one instead.
  - Add spacing properties to set the grid's spacing.
  - Don't make it visible by default.
- HdyPreferencesGroup:
  - Use the .heading style class for the title in addition to .h4.
- HdyPreferencesWindow:
  - Make clicking search rows work again.
- HdySwipeable:
  - Add the get_distance(), get_range(), get_snap_points(),
    get_progress(), and get_cancel_progress() virtual methods.

  - Remove the useless has-subtitle property.
  - Prevent gtk_widget_show_all() from modifying its internal state.
