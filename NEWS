==============
Version 0.83.0
==============

- Initialization:
  - Add hdy_init() back, with a different prototype. See its
    documentation to know how to use it.
  - Drop initializing the library via a constructor as it was causing
    many issues.
  - Drop the now useless Python override.
  - Directly update themes on changes.
- Add HdySwipeTracker.
- HdySwipeable:
  - Drop the begin_swipe(), update_swipe(), end_swipe() and get_range()
    virtual methods
  - Add the get_swipe_tracker() and get_swipe_area() virtual methods.
  - Add the …_switch_child(), …_emit_child_switched(),
    …_get_swipe_tracker(), …_get_distance(), …_get_snap_points(),
    …_get_progress(), …_get_cancel_progress(), and …_get_swipe_area()
    functions.
  - Make implementing get_snap_points() mandatory by dropping its
    default implementation, compensating the disparition of get_range().
  - Rename the switch-child signal to child-switched to avoid a naming
    collision with the switch_child() method.
- HdyDeck and HdyLeaflet:
  - Add an outline to shadows to make them slightly more contrasted yet
    subtle.
  - Make shadows work over OpenGL content.
  - Cache shadows for child transitions.
  - Stop drawing invisible shadows when no transition is running.
  - Rewrite the transition code to give a window to all children, fixing
    numerous issues.
- HdyExpanderRow:
  - Add hdy_expander_row_add_prefix().
- Add libhandy.syms back to tarballs as it was mistakenly removed.
- Translation updates:
  - Polish
  - Spanish

==============
Version 0.82.0
==============

- Unblacklist run.in for inclusion into the tarball, fixing the build.
- HdyClamp:
  - Rename HdyColumn as HdyClamp.
  - Make it implement GtkOrientable.
  - Rename its properties from maximum-width to maximum-size, and
    linear-growth-width to tightening-threshold.
  - Rename the style classes it sets on itself from .narrow, .medium and
    .wide style to .small, .medium and .large.
  - Set the default value of maximum-size to 600, and of
    tightening-threshold to 400.
  - Notify when changing size properties, and guard non-changes.
- HdyCarousel, HdyDeck and HdyLeaflet:
  - Move the swipe tracker event handling to the bubble phase, giving
    the priority to the inner widget.
- HdyDeck:
  - Avoid some useless allocation computations.
- HdyLeaflet:
  - Don't count children of size 0 to compute the fold state.
  - Don't fold when there is only 1 visible size.
- HdySwipeable:
  - Add the missing direct header inclusion guard.
- HdyWindow and HdyApplicationWindow:
  - Implement destroy() to correctly destroy the internal widgets.
- Drop hdy_list_box_separator_header().
- Don't install Glade files outside prefix.
- Update the project description.
- Translation updates:
  - Spanish
  - Ukrainian

==============
Version 0.81.0
==============

- Migrated the project to https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libhandy/.
  - Archived the project at https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/.
  - Updated URLs and email addresses across the project.
  - Switch the CI to use GNOME's.
  - Build and publish the nightly reference manual via GitLab Pages at
    https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libhandy/.
- Make the reference manual and the Glade catalog parallel-installable
  with libhandy 0.0.
- Add a Python override to ensure the library is initialized on import.
- Themes:
  - Add the HighContrast theme.
  - Split the shared theme into the fallback theme whose style can be
    overridden by other themes, and the shared theme whose style
    overrides the themes.
  - Move window corners from the shared theme to Adwaita, so elementary
    can do what they want.
  - Make the leaflet and deck drop shadows darker for dark variants and
    HighContrast, to ensure it's visible.
  - Drop the .h4 fallback to avoid conflicts with .heading. Themes are
    now expected to implement .heading, or optionally .h4.
  - Fix list.preferences nested list bottom corner rounding issues.
- CSS support:
  - Account for the CSS box-shadow property when clipping in HdyAvatar,
    HdyHeaderBar, and HdyTitleBar.
  - Support the CSS min-width and min-height properties in HdyHeaderBar,
    and HdyTitleBar.
- HdyDeck and HdyLeaflet:
  - Add *_get_adjacent_child() to get the child a swipe or a call to
    *_navigate() would present.
  - Don't skip the swipes with a 0 (child for leaflet) transition
    duration.
  - Correctly cancel transitions when the duration is 0 or the
    transition is NONE.
- HdyCarousel:
  - Allow mouse drag by default.
  - Add the 'reveal-duration' property.
  - Animate child addition and deletion.
- HdyExpanderRow:
  - Move switch to the left of the arrow.
  - Add hdy_expander_row_add_action_widget() and the 'action' child type
    to allow adding widgets before the arrow and the switch.
- HdyHeaderBar:
  - Add the .titlebar style class by default.
- HdyKeypad:
  - Make it inherit from GtkBin instead of GtkGrid, contain one instead.
  - Add spacing properties to set the grid's spacing.
  - Don't make it visible by default.
- HdyPreferencesGroup:
  - Use the .heading style class for the title in addition to .h4.
- HdyPreferencesWindow:
  - Make clicking search rows work again.
- HdySwipeable:
  - Add the get_distance(), get_range(), get_snap_points(),
    get_progress(), and get_cancel_progress() virtual methods.
- HdyViewSwitcherTitle:
  - Remove the useless has-subtitle property.
  - Prevent gtk_widget_show_all() from modifying its internal state.
  - Make dispose() reentrant.
