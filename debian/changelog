libhandy (0.0.10) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * .editorconfig: Add CSS
  * arrows: Refresh HdyArrowsDirection docs.
    This moves the HdyArrowsDirection documentation to the C file and
    removes the final period from the values definitions, like for all other
    enums documentations.
  * docs: Add section for new symbols in 0.0.10
  * view-switcher: Fix stack children callbacks.
    This fixes the callbacks when a child is added or removed from the view
    switcher's stack.
  * view-switcher-button: Make an active button's label bold.
    This makes the view switcher easier to read.
    It uses multiple labels with or without the specific style rather than a
    single label with the style toggled on and off to ensure the size
    requests don't change depending on whether the button is active or not.
  * leaflet: Synchronize paired notifications.
    This ensures users can't react to a visible child change notification or
    a fold change notification before we finish emitting all related
    notifications.
  * Add HdySqueezer.
    This can be used to automatically hide a widget like a HdyViewSwitcher
    in a header bar when there is not enough space for it and show a title
    label instead.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/100
  * examples: Use a HdySqueezer.
    Use a HdySqueezer in the view switcher window to show either the view
    switcher in the header bar, or a window title and a view switcher bar
    depending on the window's width.
  * view-switcher-button: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher: Allow to elipsize in narrow mode.
    This will be used to let HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-bar: Ellipsize in narrow mode.
    This lets HdyViewSwitcherBar reach even narrower widths.
  * view-switcher-button: Use buttons borders in size.
    When computing the size of the button, take the button's border into
    account.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/108
  * view-switcher-bar: Sort properties by alphabetical order.
    This fixes a code style error and will avoid to propagate it as the file
    gets edited.
  * view-switcher-bar: Add margins.
    Add margings around the view switcher to better match the mockups.
  * view-switcher: Define a minimum natural width.
    This prevents the buttons from looking terribly narrow in a wide bar by
    making them request a minimum good looking natural size.
  * Add HdyPreferencesRow.
    This will be used as the base row for the preferences window, offering
    data needed to search a preference entry.
  * action-row: Extend HdyPreferencesRow.
    This allows to use HdyActionRow and its derivatives as preferences rows.
  * Add HdyPreferencesGroup.
    This will be used to group preferences rows as a coherent group in a
    preferences page.
  * Add HdyPreferencesPage.
    This will be used to group preferences as pages in a preferences window.
  * Add HdyPreferencesWindow.
    This allows to easily create searchable preferences windows.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/101
  * examples: Add a HdyPreferencesWindow example
  * Add private GtkWindow functions.
    Add the private GtkWindow functions _gtk_window_toggle_maximized()
    and gtk_window_get_icon_for_size() which will be used in the next commit
    by HdyHeaderBar.
  * Add HdyHeaderBar.
    Fork GtkHeaderBar to help fixing shortcomings caused by adaptive designs
    or coming from GtkHeaderBar itself as features are not accepted into GTK
    3 anymore.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/102
  * examples: Use HdyHeaderBar in the View Switcher page.
    This correctly centers the view switcher and demoes HdyHeaderBar.
  * view-switcher: Recommend to use a HdyHeaderBar.
    This will help users of HdyViewSwitcher to know how to make it look
    good in a header bar.
  * examples: Drop un unused signal connection.
    This avoids a run time warning.
  * docs: Add images for HdyViewSwitcher and HdyViewSwitcherBar
  * preferences-window: Strictly center the header bar.
    This makes the header bar's widgets look better by ensuring they are
    always centered, even if it means they will be narrower.
  * conbo-row: Make the popover relative to the arrow.
    Consistently point to the arrow rather than sometimes to the arrow and
    sometimes to the invisible box containing the current value.
  * combo-row: Add HdyComboRowGetName.
    Replace HdyComboRowCreateLabelData by HdyComboRowGetName and keep a
    reference to in the combo row to allow accessing it externally. It will
    be needed to automatically handle converting the value into a name to
    display as the subtitle of the row.
  * combo-row: Add the use-subtitle property.
    Allow to display the current value as the subtitle rather than at the
    end of the row.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/95
  * header-bar: Render margins and borders.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/121

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherButton.
    This will be used in the next commit by HdyViewSwitcher.
  * Add HdyViewSwitcher.
    This more modern and adaptive take on GtkStackSwitcher helps building
    adaptive UIs for phones.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/64
  * Add HdyViewSwitcherBar.
    This action bar offers a HdyViewSwitcher and is designed to be put at
    the bottom of windows. It is designed to be revealed when the header bar
    doesn't have enough room to fit a HdyViewSwitcher, helping the windows
    to reach narrower widths.
  * examples: Add the View Switcher page.
    This example presents a HdyViewSwitcher and a HdyViewSwitcherBar in
    their own window. Currently both are visible at the same time, a later
    commit should make only one visible at a time, depending on the
    available width.
