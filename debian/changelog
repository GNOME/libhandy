libhandy (0.0.9) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Benjamin Berg ]
  * glade: Mark ActionRow properties as translatable/icon.
    Without this, it is impossible to set the translatable flag in glade,
    making it hard to create proper UI definitions.

  [ Bastien Nocera ]
  * Use correct i18n include.
    From the Internationalization section of the GLib API docs:
    In order to use these macros in an application, you must include
    <glib/gi18n.h>. For use in a library, you must include <glib/gi18n-lib.h>
    after defining the GETTEXT_PACKAGE macro suitably for your library
  * Fix broken translations in all libhandy applications.
    Translations in all the applications using libhandy would be broken
    after a call to hdy_init() as it changed the default gettext translation
    domain.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/issues/393

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * examples: Update the Flatpak command.
    The command should changed with the demo application name.
  * leaflet: Improve the slide child transition description.
    This makes the slide child transition description match the one of the
    slide mode transition one.
  * action-row: Upcast self to check the activated row.
    Upcast the HdyActionRow rather than downcasting the activated row to
    compare their pointers. This prevents error messages when a sibbling row
    that isn't a HdyActionRow is activated. Also use a simple cast rather
    than a safe cast as it is there only to please the compiler and is
    useless for a pointer comparison and it's faster.
  * Drop 'dialer' from the UI resources path.
    This makes the UI file paths more correct and simpler.
  * leaflet: Add hdy_leaflet_stop_child_transition()
    This makes the code clearer by encapsulating child mode transition
    cancellation into its own function.
  * leaflet: Factorize bin window move and resize.
    This ensures we move or resize it consistently.
  * leaflet: Move the bin window on child transition cancellation.
    This avoids the children to be drawn out of place when a mode transition
    is triggered while a child transition was ongoing.
    Fixes https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/issues/93
  * Add HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY.
    Add and use HDY_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY to help ensuring custom styling
    is applied consistently and correctly accross all the library.
  * expander-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * combo-row: Move the custom style to a resource.
    This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and simnpler to modify.
  * expander-row: Add the expanded property.
    This can be used to reveal external widgets depending on the state of
    the row.

  * debian: Test GObject introspection.
    This makes sure we have the typelib file installed correctly.
  * debian/tests: Drop API version from include.
    This makes sure we respect pkg-config's findings.
  * examples: Add API version to demo name.
    This makes different versions co-installable.
  * build: Don't hardcode API version
  * Release libhandy 0.0.9
