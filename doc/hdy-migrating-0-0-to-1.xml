  <title>Migrating from Handy 0.0.x to Handy 1</title>

  <section>
    <title>Changes that need to be done at the time of the switch</title>

    <para>
      This section outlines porting tasks that you need to tackle when you get
      to the point that you actually build your application against Handy 1.
      Making it possible to prepare for these in Handy 0.0 would have been
      either impossible or impractical.

      <para>
        The HdyLeafletModeTransitionType and HdyLeafletChildTransitionType types
