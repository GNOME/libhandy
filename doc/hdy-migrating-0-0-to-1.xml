  <para>
    Handy 1 is a major new version of Handy that breaks both API and ABI
    compared to Handy 0.0.x. Thankfully, most of the changes are not hard to
    adapt to and there are a number of steps that you can take to prepare your
    Handy 0.0.x application for the switch to Handy 1. After that, there's a
    number of adjustments that you may have to do when you actually switch your
    application to build against Handy 1.
  </para>

  <refsect2>
    <title>Preparation in Handy 0.0.x</title>

    <para>
      The steps outlined in the following sections assume that your application
      is working with Handy 0.0.13, which is the final stable release of Handy
      0.0.x. It includes all the necessary APIs and tools to help you port your
      application to Handy 1. If you are using an older version of Handy 0.0.x,
      you should first get your application to build and work with Handy 0.0.13.
    </para>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Do not use the static build option</title>
      <para>
        Static linking support has been removed, and so did the static build
        option.
        You must adapt you program to link to the library dynamically, using
        the package_subdir build option if needed.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Do not use deprecated symbols</title>
      <para>
        Over the years, a number of functions, and in some cases, entire widgets
        have been deprecated. These deprecations are clearly spelled out in the
        API reference, with hints about the recommended replacements.
        The API reference for GTK 3 also includes an
        <ulink url="https://developer.puri.sm/projects/libhandy/unstable/deprecated-api-index.html">index</ulink>
        of all deprecated symbols.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

  </refsect2>

  <refsect2>
    <title>Changes that need to be done at the time of the switch</title>

    <para>
      This section outlines porting tasks that you need to tackle when you get
      to the point that you actually build your application against Handy 1.
      Making it possible to prepare for these in Handy 0.0 would have been
      either impossible or impractical.
    </para>

    <refsect3>
      <title>hdy_init has been removed</title>
      <para>
        hdy_init() has been removed.
        Instead, Handy 1 comes with a library constructor which will
        automatically initialize it when linked.
        You should just remove calls to hdy_init().
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to widget constructor changes</title>
      <para>
        All widget constructors now return the #GtkWidget type rather than the
        constructed widget's type, following the same convention as GTK 3.
      </para>
      <para>
        Affected widgets:
        #HdyActionRow, #HdyColumn, #HdyComboRow, #HdyExpanderRow,
        #HdyPreferencesGroup, #HdyPreferencesPage, #HdyPreferencesRow,
        #HdyPreferencesWindow, #HdySqueezer, #HdyTitleBar, #HdyViewSwitcherBar,
        #HdyViewSwitcher
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>HdyFold has been removed</title>
      <para>
        #HdyFold has been removed. This affects the API of #HdyLeaflet, see the
        “Adapt to HdyLeaflet API changes” section to know how.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Replace HdyPaginator by HdyCarousel</title>
      <para>
        HdyPaginator has been renamed HdyCarousel, so you should replace the
        former by the later.
        Similarly, HdyPaginatorIndicatorStyle has been renamed
        HdyCarouselIndicatorStyle.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyLeaflet API changes</title>
      <para>
        The #HdyFold type has been removed in favor of using a boolean, and
        #HdyLeaflet adjusted to that as the #HdyLeaflet:fold property has been
        removed in favor of #HdyLeaflet:folded.
        Also, the hdy_leaflet_get_homogeneous() and
        hdy_leaflet_set_homogeneous() accessors take a boolean parameter instead
        of a #HdyFold.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyLeaflet API changes</title>
      <para>
        The default value for the #HdyLeaflet:transition-type property is
        changed from “none” to “over”.
        “over” is the recommanded transtion for typical #HdyLeaflet use-cases,
        if this isn't what you want to use, be sure to adapt your code.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyViewSwitcher API changes</title>
      <para>
        #HdyViewSwitcher doesn't subclass #GtkBox anymore. Instead, it
        subclasses #GtkBin and contains a box.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyViewSwitcherBar API changes</title>
      <para>
        #HdyViewSwitcherBar won't be revealed if the #HdyViewSwitcherBar:stack
        property is %NULL or if it has less than two pages, even if you set
        #HdyViewSwitcherBar:reveal to %TRUE.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to CSS node name changes</title>
      <para>
        Widgets with a customn CSS node name got their name changed to be the
        class' name in lowercase, with no separation between words, and with no
        namespace prefix. E.g. the CSS node name of HdyViewSwitcher is
        viewswitcher.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyActionRow API changes</title>
      <para>
        Action items were packed from the end toward the start of the row. It is
        now reversed, and widgets have to be packed from the start to the end.
      </para>
      <para>
        It isn't possible to add children at the bottom of a #HdyActionRow
        anymore, instead use other widgets like #HdyExpanderRow.
        Widgets added to a #HdyActionRow will now be added at the end of the
        row, and the hdy_action_row_add_action() method and the action child
        type have been removed.
      </para>
      <para>
        The main horizontal box of #HdyActionRow had the row-header CSS style
        class, it now has the header CSS style class and can hence be accessed
        as box.header subnode.
      </para>
      <para>
        #HdyActionRow is now unactivatable by default, giving it an activatable
        widget will automatically make it activatable.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyComboRow API changes</title>
      <para>
        #HdyComboRow is now unactivatable by default, binding and unbinding a
        model will toggle its activatability.
      </para>
    </refsect3>

    <refsect3>
      <title>Adapt to HdyExpanderRow API changes</title>
      <para>
        #HdyExpanderRow doesn't descend from #HdyActionRow anymore but from
        #HdyPreferencesRow.
        It reimplement some features from #HdyActionRow, like the
        #HdyExpanderRow:title, #HdyExpanderRow:subtitle,
        #HdyExpanderRow:use-underline and #HdyExpanderRow:icon-name, but it
        doesn't offer the “activate” signal nor the ability to add widgets in
        its header row.
      </para>
      <para>
        Widgets you add to it will be added to its inner #GtkListBox.
      </para>
